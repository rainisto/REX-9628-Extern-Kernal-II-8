# REX-9628-Extern-Kernal-II-8
DL2DW's remake of REX 9628 Extern-Kernal II-8 clone card 

Seems that DL2DW deleted them from his personal blog, so I'll put them available here again as permitted by CC BY-NC-SA license.

[Manual]
EXTERNAL KERNAL 8 9628

On this board, "EXTERNAL KERNAL 8", can accommodate up to 8 kernals
operated (2x8 to 32K Eproms). 100% compatible e.g. to all speeders like Speeddos,
Rex-DOS, Prologic-DOS etc... Suitable for all 64's, also that of ALDI. Board is 
at the expansion port operated.

You can use 1 x 2764 or 27128 or 27256 per socket. From
each EPROM is addressed in each case the corresponding 8K range.

About the two DIL switches, the respective eighth and slot 1
and 2 are addressed.

The 4-pin DIL switch:
<pre>
Switch        1    2    3    4       Slot 1    Slot 2
======================================================
             on  off   on  off       2764       2764
             on  off   on  off      27128      27128
            off   on  off   on      27256      27256
             on  off  off   on     2764/128    27256
            off   on   on  off      27256     2764/128
</pre>
The 10-pin DIL switch:
<pre>
Switch (on)        slot   kernal number on EPROM
====================================================
                 1   1              1
               2-1   1              2
             3-2-1   1              3
           4-3-2-1   1              4
         5-4-3-2-1   2              1
       6-5-4-3-2-1   2              2
     7-6-5-4-3-2-1   2              3
   8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1   2              4

                 9 turns Game Stop on or off
                10 turns the card on or off
</pre>
If nothing else is set, the card automatically jumps to the
1st kernal in the 1st slot.

If used EPROM is bugger than 8K, ie. 27128 or 27256, then
kernals must be burned one after the other in 8K blocks each.
See the following address table:

<pre>
   Kernal         addresses 27128     addresses 27256
=====================================================
      1              0000 - 1FFF        0000 - 1FFF
      2              2000 - 3FFF        2000 - 3FFF
      3                                 4000 - 5FFF
      4                                 6000 - 7FFF
</pre>
The EPROMs must match the notch of the socket when plugged in.
